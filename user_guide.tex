\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Spectra of the earth's thermal emission as measured by the AIRS
\cite{airs1}, CrIS\cite{cris1,cris2}, and IASI \cite{iasi1}
hyper-spectral sounders are a significant part of the long term
climate record.  These instruments have broadly similar spatial
sampling, spectral resolution, and band spans.  But the spectral
response functions differ in detail, leading to significant
differences in observed spectra.  The CHIRP product provides a
single, combined record of these data, by taking advantage of the
similar spatial sampling and translating AIRS and CrIS radiances to
a common format.  The translation from CrIS to CHIRP is done by
resampling or double Fourier interpolation.  Translation from AIRS
to CHIRP is more involved.  AIRS is a grating spectrometer with a
distinct response function for each channel, while CrIS is a
Michelson interferometer with a sinc response function.  We use our
knowledge of the AIRS spectral response functions to deconvolve AIRS
channel radiances to a resolution enhanced intermediate
representation, which is then reconvolved to the CHIRP user grid.

The CHIRP record starts with AIRS data from Fall 2002, and will
cross over to CrIS SNPP or NOAA-20 and continue in the future with
NOAA-21, 22, etc., with sounder crossover dates to be determined.
These sounders share an ascending PM equatorial crossing time and
will become the CHIRP-1330 product.  Although the primary product is
a single record, support products in the form of translations for
other NOAA sounders may also be provided.  CHIRP-1330 is made
available by JPL Sounder SIPS as a product at the GSFC-DISC.  In the
future IASI may be added, for a CHIRP-1030 product.

\section{Data Format}
\label{format}

AIRS L1c and CrIS L1b radiance data are organized as a sequence of
granule files, ordered by scan geometery and observation time.
CHIRP granules correspond with their parent AIRS or CrIS granules,
and inherit most of the parent granule's attributes and supporting
data.  CHIRP granules follow JPL conventions for field names and
attributes, and are saved in netCDF.  There are 1679 CHIRP channels,
described in detail in section \ref{rad}.  A CHIRP observation, or
``obs'' for short, is a 1679-channel radiance vector with associated
values for time, FOV (for CrIS), original indices for AIRS or CrIS,
along with most of the geolocation, support data, and product
attributes from the parent sounders.  This involves some duplication
of information for the individual obs, but the overhead for this is
small in comparison with the radiance data.  The key idea is that
each obs can stand alone as a largely self-sufficient unit of
information.  CHIRP data is then a list of such obs.  The CHIRP data
is organized as an $1679 \times 12150$ array, channels by obs, in
time order, while most of the supporting data is organized as
$12150$-vectors.  The choice of 12150 obs per granule is discussed
in section \ref{sampling}.

% CHIRP ILS

  \caption{The MW CHIRP apodized ILS, together with weights for the
    AIRS channels, for the CHIRP channel shown.  The AIRS weights
    are paired with the corresponding AIRS SRFs, normalized to the
    weight values.}
  \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

For a long-term record we need radiance data in a single format---a
single frequency grid with a common ILS, and to the extent possible,
similar NEdN.  CHIRP radiances are for a nominal 3-band
interferometer with an {\opd} of $0.8$ {\cm} in the long-wave (LW),
$0.6$ {\cm} in the medium-wave (MW), and $0.4$ {\cm} in the
short-wave (SW) bands, with Hamming apodization applied to each band.
The MW and SW resolutions are lower than the CrIS-parent FSR {\opd}
of $0.8$ {\cm}, and were chosen to to give an approximate match to
the AIRS resolution for those bands.  Figure \ref{fig1} shows
typical AIRS and AIRS-parent CHIRP BT spectra, the granule means for
19 Aug 2018 granule 25.  The CHIRP bands are the intersection of the
AIRS and CrIS bands.  Figure \ref{fig2} is a MW detail from Figure
\ref{fig1}.  Note that the AIRS and CHIRP data are on two different
grids, and what we mainly see is the effect of the CHIRP
apodization.

For CrIS-parent CHIRP, we interpolate the CrIS Full Spectral
Resolution (FSR) product, with an $0.8$ {\cm} {\opd} for all three
bands, to the CHIRP grid and then apply Hamming apodization.  The
CrIS-parent CHIRP ILS is then a Hamming-apodized sinc for a $0.8$
{\cm} {\opd} in the LW, $0.6$ {\cm} in the MW, and $0.4$ {\cm} in
the SW.  Figure \ref{fig3} shows this ILS for a typical CHIRP MW
channel.

We want to match this ILS for the AIRS-parent data.  But AIRS is a
grating spectrometer with a distinct response function for each
channel, while CrIS is a Michelson interferometer with a sinc
response function after calibration and corrections.  We use our
detailed knowledge of the AIRS spectral response functions to
deconvolve AIRS channel radiances to a resolution enhanced
intermediate representation.  This is done by taking a Moore-Penrose
pseudo-inverse of the tabulated AIRS SRFs and applying this to the
AIRS radiances, giving us deconvolved data at a $0.1$ {\wn} grid.
This is then reconvolved to the CHIRP user grid via resampling or
double Fourier interpolation.  The resulting translation can be
shown to be more accurate than more conventional interpolation or
regression \cite{mott2018}.  Figure \ref{fig3} includes the AIRS
channel weights and corresponding AIRS SRFs, normalized to the weight
values, for AIRS-parent data for this channel.  The weights are from
a row of a linearized approximation of the AIRS to CHIRP translation.

Hamming apodization (as mentioned above) and an optional bias
correction are applied to both translations.  Currently AIRS and
CrIS J1 parent are adjusted to match CrIS SNPP \cite{strow2021a}.
After translation from CrIS, the three bands have 713, 649, and 317
channels, respectively.  These are concatenated for the CHIRP
product, for a total of 1679 channels.  The CHIRP user grid does not
have a constant step size, the frequency steps are $1/(2 \,\opd)$.
The CHIRP field \texttt{wnum} is a 1679-vector which gives channel
frequencies, and \texttt{rad} is a 1679 by 12150 array of radiance
data.  AIRS-parent CHIRP uses the same channel set.  However the
AIRS-to-CHIRP translation gives only 1483 channels, due to slightly
different band spans.  These are embedded in the 1679 channel set,
with missing channels flagged as described in section \ref{qcnedn}.

  \label{fig7}
\end{figure}

AIRS and CrIS spatial sampling are similar, but not identical.
AIRS and CrIS are both in sun-synchronous polar orbits.  The CrIS
orbital period is 101.5 minutes, giving 227 orbits every 16 days.
The AIRS orbital period 98.8 minutes, giving 233 orbits every 16
days.  Note that 227 and 233 are both prime; there are no common
factors and so no repeating subpatterns.  Figure \ref{fig4} shows
global values for satellite subpoint for one day of AIRS and CrIS
data, and figure \ref{fig5} for 16 days, the full period before any
repeated postitions, for the Caribbean.  AIRS and CrIS are
cross-track scanners, and in addition to subpoint tracks we want to
compare the scan geometry.  Figure \ref{fig6} shows the secant of
zenith angles for AIRS and CrIS.  The upper plot is for the full
scan widths, while the lower is a near-nadir detail.  The general
agreement is quite good, and the main difference we see is due to
the CrIS FOV grouping.

The AIRS L1c scan geometery is organized as 90 cross-track by 135
along-track observations, giving $90 \times 135 = 12150$ obs per
granule.  The CrIS L1b scan geometery is organized as 9 FOVs
arranged in a $3 \times 3$ field of regard (FOR), giving 9
simultaneous observations.  There are 30 cross-track FOR looks and
45 along-track FOR steps.  So again we have $9 \times 30 \times 45 =
12150$ obs per granule.  Figure \ref{fig7} shows the relationship of
the CrIS FOVs and FOR as the scan moves from nadir to limb.  Due to
this rotation, we can't treat the CrIS data as a simple cross-track
by along-track grid, as with the AIRS, for example for imaging.
CHIRP provides both AIRS- and CrIS-style indexing for all products,
AIRS-style indexing in the fields \texttt{airs\_xtrack} and
\texttt{airs\_atrack}, and CrIS-style indexing, where xtrack and
atrack are FOR rather than FOV indices, in the fields
\texttt{xtrack}, \texttt{atrack} and \texttt{fov\_num}.

\section{Quality Control and NEdN Estimates}
\label{qcnedn}

CHIRP Quality Control (QC) is straighforward.  There are two QC
fields per granule, \texttt{rad\_qc}, a 12150-vector with one flag
per obs, and \texttt{chan\_qc}, a 1679-vector with one flag per
channel.  For both vectors, 0 = OK, 1 = warn, and 2 = bad.  For
CrIS-parent CHIRP these fields are a summary of the parent product
state.  For AIRS-parent CHIRP the situation is more complex, due to
a significant and variable number of AIRS synthetic channels, and
because the set of 1483 channels from the AIRS translation are a
subset of the 1679 channels from the CrIS translation.

\subsection{AIRS-parent CHIRP QC}

For AIRS-parent CHIRP the 1679-element vector \texttt{chan\_qc} is
set to 2 (bad) for those channels that are not part of the 1483
channel set, as translated from AIRS.  This is a compromise that
give us a single freqency grid for CHIRP, regardless of the parent
sounder.  If we begin by choosing a set of channels to work with
AIRS-parent data, we can continue using that set with the change to
CrIS-parent, with no changes in our indexing.  In addition to
flagging missing channels, \texttt{chan\_qc} is set to 1 (warn) for
the six channels at the translation band edges, and when the
synthetic component exceeds a threshold, as described below.

The 12150-element vector \texttt{rad\_qc} has a flag for each obs.
These are set to 0 (OK) if the L1c field \texttt{instrument\_state}
is OK and radiance and geo values pass some basic sanity checks.
\texttt{rad\_qc} is always 0 or 2 for AIRS-parent CHIRP, because
AIRS L1c doesn't have a warn flag.

\subsection{AIRS Synthetic Channels}

As an alternative to a warn flag, and to fill band gaps, AIRS L1c
provides synthetic values for some observations and channels.  That
is, for a particular observation--a radiance vector with an
associated time, geolocation, et cetera---some of the channels may
be synthetic.  Some of these channels are synthetic only
occasionally, others more frequently, and some are always synthetic.
These are all flagged in the L1c file for every observation and
channel.  In addition, the granule file has a per-granule summary,
L1cNumSynth, for each L1c channel.  This is the number of times the
channel was filled with a synthetic value.  L1cNumSynth can range
from zero, for no synthetic values, to 12150, for all synthetic.
Figure \ref{fig8} shows the sum of all synthetic values by channel,
for 5036 consecutive AIRS granules, approximately 21 days of data.
Counts are shown on a log scale.  Figure \ref{fig9} shows the same
data as synthetic values per channel, sorted by number of synthetic
values.  This shows the wide range of values, from few or no
synthetic values for some channels, to entirely synthetic values for
others.

For some applications we may not want a significant synthetic
component.  The CHIRP field \texttt{synth\_frac} provides the AIRS
synthetic component for each CHIRP channel.  This can range from
zero, for no synthetic component, to one, for entirely synthetic.
To get this value we linearize the AIRS to CrIS translation and
apply it to the AIRS L1cNumSynth, to get a corresponding NumSynth
value for CHIRP.  This is normalized as a fraction and becomes the
CHIRP field \texttt{synth\_frac}.  Figure \ref{fig10} shows the
AIRS-parent CHIRP synthetic fraction for a single representative
granule. This can be used to select channels with a relatively small
synthetic component.  Figure \ref{fig11} show the AIRS-parent CHIRP
synthetic fraction, sorted by synthetic fraction magnitude.  This
shows the variability of \texttt{synth\_frac}.  If
$\hbox{\texttt{synth\_frac}} > 0.25$, we set \texttt{chan\_qc} to
warn.  The threshold $0.25$ is a parameter that can be changed in
the production YAML specs.

    the granules shown in figure \ref{fig12}.  The noise is
    significantly less for the translations.}
  \label{fig12}
\end{figure}

\subsection{AIRS-parent CHIRP NEdN}

To find {\nedn} for AIRS-parent CHIRP, we start with an AIRS L1c
{\nedn} estimate.  Unfortunately the synthetic obs do not include
values for {\nedn}.  As a compromise we take the mean of valid
{\nedn} values over an AIRS granule and interpolate over the gaps
for the synthetic channels.  Given the AIRS estimate, we add
Gaussian noise at the AIRS {\nedn} to a black-body spectra at 280K,
do the translation, and measure the resulting noise.  This is done
repeatedly and the mean of the measurement is reported.  Details are
described in \cite{mott2018}.  The correlated fraction of AIRS noise
varies from module to module, and is significant for some modules.
The translation will preserve this correlation.  {\nedn} estimates
for this case are a matter for future work.

Figure \ref{fig12} shows typical values for AIRS and CrIS {\nedn}
for 2018 doy 231 granules 25 and 21, respectively; two relatively
warm granules.  Figure \ref{fig12} shows the corresponding CHIRP
{\nedn} for AIRS and CrIS parent data, for the same granules.
The noise is significantly less for the translation.  This to be
expected since both apodization and down-interpolation reduce noise.

\subsection{CrIS-parent CHIRP QC and NEdN}

In contrast with AIRS, CrIS-parent CHIRP QC and {\nedn} are
relatively simple.  CrIS-parent CHIRP QC is determined from the CrIS
parent, by combining the fields for the individual CrIS bands.
\texttt{chan\_qc} is set to 0 (OK) for CrIS-parent CHIRP.  Possibly
we should set \texttt{chan\_qc} to warn at the band edges, as we do
for AIRS parent, but we are not doing this now.  CrIS-parent CHIRP
{\nedn} is derived from the high res CrIS {\nedn} with scale factors
to take into account the interpolation and apodization.  These are
\begin{itemize}
   \item LW, 0.6325, for Hamming apodization only
   \item MW, 0.5455, for interpolation and Hamming apodization
   \item SW, 0.4446, for interpolation and Hamming apodization
\end{itemize}
