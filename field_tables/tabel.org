The meaning and order of values for each point's coordinates depends on the coordinate reference system (CRS). The ACDD default is 2D geometry in the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. The default may be overridden with geospatial_bounds_crs and geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs (see those attributes). EPSG:4326 coordinate values are longitude (decimal degrees_east) and latitude (decimal degrees_north), in that order. Longitude values in the default case are limited to the [-180, 180) range. Example: 'POLYGON ((-111.29 40.26, -111.29 41.26, -110.29 41.26, -110.29 40.26, -111.29 40.26))'.   |
