Howard,

Here are the autogenerated interface tables for CHIRP.

We typically put them in Appendix A of a User Guide.

docs.chirp_1330.html is the main one.  It could be appendix A with
very little massaging.

These are in HTML format, which pastes easily into MS Word and
probably most other tools, but we could make other formats if HTML
doesnâ€™t work for you.

 A     4 chirp_1330.attrs.html      [text/html, base64, us-ascii, 34K]
 A     5 chirp_1330.dims.html       [text/html, base64, us-ascii, 1.2K]
 A     6 chirp_1330.groups.html     [text/html, base64, us-ascii, 0.3K]
 A     7 chirp_1330.html            [text/html, base64, us-ascii, 8.9K]
 A     8 docs.chirp_1330.html       [text/html, base64, us-ascii, 46K]

need to sort these out:
  tabel.tex
  chirp_1330.tex
  test.tex
  test_wrap.tex
